        <p style="text-align: left;" id="dear">Dear Nakita, </p>
            You are literally one of the best things to ever happen to me.Meeting you was one of the best coincidences ever.But if I am being compleetely
            honest,I didn't think that I would love you this much. I wasn't even sure that we would ever speak again. Praise be to God because he put
            you in my life and me in yours. I will never,for a single day regret talking to you or falling for you. You are an AMAZING person Nakita that
            I am pleased to  have had the pleasure of meeting. You somehow have earned my trust and no matter what goes down from here I LOVE you. 
            I will always be here for you no matter the physical distance between us. You're my ride or die. <br>
            I LOVE YOU TO THE MOON AND BACK.
