        <h1>MADAM PRESIDENT</h1>
        <p>Here we have an amazing friend. I'd say a long lost friend but it feels like she never left.</p>
        <p class = "speech">Claire has been such an instrumental person in my life thus far. I appreciate the ears she has lent to my
            childish predicaments from time to time. Though we were separated for a while after I moved schools,it feels like you never left.
         I genuinely wish you the best in whatever you seek to achieve.May the Lord keep you and may he grant your heart's desires. </p>
