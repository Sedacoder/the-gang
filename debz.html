       <p class="opening">God works in mysterious yet always wonderful ways. He has brought into my life the one thing i've never had.A sister.
        Seemingly,by force. He presented me with an opportunity to talk to her. I didn't.Even then,he made sure I met my <span class="keys">AMAZING SISTER,DEBORAH
        KANAGA ANGAYA</span>.I thank God everyday for bringing this amazing person into my life. In the shortest time possible,she has had a <span class = "keys">MASSIVE</span>
        impact on me and I <span class = "keys">LOVE</span> her so much.

         <p style ="text-align: left;">Dear Sister,</p>
         <blockquote id = "note">I even lack words to appreciate you for being such a wonderful addition to my life. You are <span class= "keys">
                AMAZING</span> beyond your ears and you should never dare to forget or doubt that. I might not have got the priviledge of knowing
                you for so long(I REGRET THAT).However,I can already tell you're a beautiful soul. Your reverence for God and your dedication towards him
                are an inspiration to me. You know in the book of 1 Kings...I almost started preaching.
                Back to what i was saying...You're a real inspiration to me and I pray that we remain together forever. May no darts of the enemy separate us.
                It doesn't matter where I'll be or who I'll be. I MUST pull up to your wedding. He who finds a wife finds a good thing(Prov 18:22). He who finds
                my sister,Deborah Waweru,has to be the luckiest fellow in the world.I think I've over-stressed this,<br><span id = "end">I love you Deborah(With the
                love of Christ),as my amazing sister,always.</span>
